<li><a href="https://github.com/maxwtrumpet/maxtrumpetPortfolio">The Legend of Zelda (Unity Remaster)</a></li>
</ul>

  This is a remaster of the NES Legend of Zelda in Unity. It was developed using C# and Visual Studio for script creation, 
  Photoshop for novel sprite creation, and the BeepBox website for novel music arrangements/sound effects.

  Press the 1 button for cheats, and the 4 button for a new level and mechanic.
  
  In this project, I was responsible for most aspects of development except for enemies - and I also worked on a couple of enemies like the Blade Trap. 
  My partner did have to rework a few things related to enemies as he went through enemy development, but I built the groundwork for all facets of game
  that you see in the finished project. I also developed the new mechanic, designed the level, and created the appropriate sprites/sounds. 

  Enjoy!
