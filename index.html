</ul>

  This is a remaster of the NES Legend of Zelda in Unity. It was developed using C# and Visual Studio for script creation, 
  Photoshop for novel sprite creation, and the BeepBox website for novel music arrangements/sound effects.

  Press the 1 button for cheats, and the 4 button for a new level and mechanic.
  
  In this project, I was responsible for most aspects of development except for enemies - and I also worked on a couple of enemies like the Blade Trap. 
  My partner did have to rework a few things related to enemies as he went through enemy development, but I built the groundwork for all facets of game
  that you see in the finished project. I also developed the new mechanic, designed the level, and created the appropriate sprites/sounds. 

  Enjoy!

</ul>

  This is an original game of mine in which you play as a square who has the ability to move, jump, wall climb, and grapple.
  You yearn to lose your edges and become a circle, so you hunt liminal space for the elusive 12 pie pieces that are rumored to turn the collector into a circle.
  Solve platforming puzzles to reach the end of the game. There is no cheat mode in this game, so rely on your skill to make it through the entire game. Good luck!

  I was responsible for everything in this game, from art & music, to gameplay & level design. It was developed using C# and Visual Studio for script creation, 
  Photoshop for novel sprite creation, and the BeepBox website for novel music arrangements/sound effects.
